// Array alternate printing

// 1. Create an array and define its elements according to the size.
// 2. Using for loop, access the elements of the array, but instead of incrementing the iterator by 1, 
// increase it by 2, so as to get alternate indexes of the array. 

        printf("Alternate elements of a given array \n");

        for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 2)

            printf( "%d\n", array[i]) ;
