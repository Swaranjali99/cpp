Approach 1 : 
// A simple solution for this problem is to store Inorder traversal of given binary search tree 
// in an auxiliary array and then by taking absolute difference of each element find the node having 
// minimum absolute difference with given target value K in linear time.


// Approach 2 : 
// An efficient solution for this problem is to take advantage of characteristics of BST. 
// Here is the algorithm to solve this problem :

// If target value K is present in given BST, then itâ€™s the node having minimum absolute difference.
//If target value K is less than the value of current node then move to the left child.
//If target value K is greater than the value of current node then move to the right child.


// Function to find node with minimum absolute 
// difference with given K 
// min_diff   --> minimum difference till now 
// min_diff_key  --> node having minimum absolute 
//                   difference with K
